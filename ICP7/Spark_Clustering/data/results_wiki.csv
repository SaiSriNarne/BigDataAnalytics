1,cancer is a leading cause of deaths worldwide. In Pakistan, one in every nine women develops breast cancer some time in her life. This high incidence of breast cancer and the poor socioeconomic conditions of Pakistan make breast self-examination (BSE) the best tool for the prevention and early diagnosis of breast cancer. Therefore, the aim of the study was to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice of BSE among female college students of Karachi, Pakistan.
0,cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide. Breast tumorigenesis encompasses both extrinsic and intrinsic factors. Among intrinsic aspects, the appearance of DNA variation can cause genetic instability, which may lead to carcinogenesis. Genome-wide association studies have found several potential breast cancer-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in many different populations. Among these, seven (rs2046210, rs1219648, rs3817198, rs3803662, rs889312, rs10941679 and rs13281615) have been shown to be significantly associated with breast cancer risk in various populations including those very similar to the Vietnamese. Here, therefore, we have investigated the relationship between these SNPs and breast cancer risk in a Vietnamese population case-control cohort. Real-time PCR high-resolution melt analysis was performed to genotype 300 breast cancer cases and 325 healthy controls, and the association between the seven SNPs and breast cancer risk was determined by analyzing the differences in allelic and genotypic frequencies between case and control groups using R software. While five of the seven showed no association with breast cancer, there was a relationship between the other two SNPs, rs2046210 and rs3803662, and the risk of developing this disease in Vietnamese women. The A allele is the risk allele for both rs2046210 (OR [95% CI] = 1.43 [1.14 - 1.78], P = 0.0015) and rs3803662 (OR [95% CI] = 1.45 [1.16 - 1.83], P = 0.001). We conclude that two polymorphisms, rs2046210 in ESR1 and rs3803662 in TNRC9, are associated with breast cancer risk in the Vietnamese population.
2,of human poisoning associated with Nicotiana glauca Graham are quite rare. Patients may consume the plant by mistaking it for spinach or use it as a folk remedy. The toxin stimulates the acetylcholine receptors in the central and autonomic nervous systems. A prompt and appropriate supportive treatment is crucial for survival.
3,dependence is major driver of ER + breast cancer, which is associated with PI3K mutation. PI3K inhibition (PI3Ki) can restore dependence on ER signaling for some hormone therapy-resistant ER + breast cancers, but is ineffective in others. Here we show that short-term supplementation with estrogen strongly enhanced Pik3caH1047R-induced mammary tumorigenesis in mice that resulted exclusively in ER + tumors, demonstrating the cooperation of the hormone and the oncogene in tumor development. Similar to human ER + breast cancers that are endocrine-dependent or endocrine-independent at diagnosis, tumor lines from this model retained ER expression but were sensitive or resistant to hormonal therapies. PI3Ki did not induce cell death but did cause upregulation of the pro-apoptotic gene BIM. BH3 mimetics or PI3Ki were unable to restore hormone sensitivity in several resistant mouse and human tumor lines. Importantly however, combination of PI3Ki and BH3 mimetics had a profound, BIM-dependent cytotoxic effect in PIK3CA-mutant cancer cells while sparing normal cells. We propose that addition of BH3 mimetics offers a therapeutic strategy to markedly improve the cytotoxic activity of PI3Ki in hormonal therapy-resistant and ER-independent PIK3CA-mutant breast cancer.
4,cancer is the main cause of cancer mortality among women. Green spaces have been recently associated with reduced cancer mortality among women. Mechanisms explaining the beneficial effect of green spaces include increased levels of physical activity and reduced exposure to air pollution, which have been both associated with cancer development.
